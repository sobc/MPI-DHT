 * @version 0.1
 * @date 16 Nov 2017
 *
 * This file implements the creation of a DHT by using the MPI
 * one-sided-communication. There is also the possibility to write or read data
 * from or to the DHT. In addition, the current state of the DHT can be written
 * to a file and read in again later.
